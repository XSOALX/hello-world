Hello World Repository
Hello, I am brand new to programming, but would like to learn how to code and create my own software/things from scratch. I know that there are many different languages out there (HTML5, JavaScript, C# etc) But I want to learn as much as possible. The ultimate goal is to obtain a degree in computer science. Not much about me, but hey, it works for the purpose of an introduction.
